;;; view of the object's hash status bits and its address:
;;; * PSEUDO-ATOMIC (requires a vop)
;;; * WITH-PINNED-OBJECTS
;;; * a very lightweight lockless algorithm that detects object movement
;;;   by copying the boxed register to an untagged register both
;;;   before and after reading the header word.
;;;   If the before and after values are the same and the header is marked
;;;   as "need stable hash" then the hash can only be the object address.
;;;   I'm not willing enough (or smart enough) to write a correctness proof.
;;;   It sounds something like our 'frlock' algorithm.

  ;; are now better arranged by approximate descending frequency in terms
  ;; of calls observed in certain test. Regardless of the fact that applications
  ;; will vary by use-cases, this seems like a good order because:
  ;;  * despite that INSTANCE is often the 2nd-most common object type in the heap
  ;;    (right behind CONS), there are probably at least as many heap words
  ;;    that are FIXNUM as instance pointers. So it stands to reason that

  ;;  * SYMBOLs are extremely common as table keys, more so than INSTANCE,
  ;;    so we should pick off SYMBOL sooner than INSTANCE as well.
  ;;  * INSTANCE (except for PATHNAME) doesn't recurse anyway - in fact
  ;;    it is particularly dumb (by design), so performing that test later
  ;;    doesn't incur much of a penalty.
  ;; Anyway, afaiu, the code below was previously ordered by gut feeling
