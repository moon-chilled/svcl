;;;; Source transforms are used by the compiler to make code more
;;;; canonical so that the compiler can compile it futher; they are
;;;; not optional. Compiler macros are an optional source rewriting
;;;; mechanism mainly for compile-time syntax checking and
;;;; optimizations that can be declined for any reason, but especially
;;;; through the use of NOTINLINE. Perhaps the actual mechanism
;;;; outside the decision to do rewriting could be reunified. We also
;;;; must pay special attention when writing compiler macros for the
;;;; purposes of cross-compiling. A problem is namespace clobbering:
;;;; these must not affect the host Lisp.

;;; A sanity-checker for an extremely common programmer error.
