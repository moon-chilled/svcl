#|
;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; And now some theory about how to turn CASE expressions which dispatch on
;;; symbols into expressions which dispatch on numbers instead. The idea is
;;; to use SYMBOL-HASH. It is easily enforceable that symbols referenced from
;;; compiled code have a hash, though generally SYMBOL-HASH is lazily computed.
;;; The masked hash maps to an integer from 0 to (ASH 1 nbits) which will be
;;; dispatched via a jump table on compiler backends which support jump tables.

;;; There are complications that make any naive attempt to dispatch on hash
;;; inadmissible. First off, any symbol could hash to the hash of a symbol
;;; in the dispatched set, so there always has to be a check for a match on
;;; the symbol. That's the easy part. The difficulty is figuring out what to
;;; do with hash collisions; but worse, symbols within a given clause of the
;;; CASE (having the same consequent) may hash differently.
;;; Consider one example.

(CASE sym
 ((u v) (cc1)) ; "CC" designates the "canonical clause" in that ordinal position
 ((w x) (cc2))
 ((y z) (cc3)))

;;; In reality, we would probably find a subset of bits of SYMBOL-HASH producing
;;; unique bins, but suppose for argument's sake that there are collisions:

hash bin 0: (u . cc1) (w . cc2)
hash bin 1: (v . cc1) (y . cc3)
hash bin 2: (x . cc2) (z . cc3)
hash bin 3: - empty -

;;; Something has to be done to resolve the selection of the consequent.
;;; Described below are 4 possible techniques.

;;; Option (I)
;;; Syntactically repeat clause consequents giving a literal rendering
;;; of the hash-table.  This is a poor choice unless the consequent
;;; is a self-evaluating object. But it has the nice property of invoking
;;; at most one IF after the jump-table-based dispatch.

(case hash
  (0 (if (eq sym 'u) (cc1) (cc2)))  ; each canonical consequent appears twice
  (1 (if (eq sym 'v) (cc1) (cc3)))
  (2 (if (eq sym 'x) (cc2) (cc3))))

;;; Option (II)
;;; Merge bins to create equivalence classes by canonical clause.

(case hash
  ((0 1) (case sym (y (cc3)) (w (cc2)) (otherwise (cc1))))
  (2 (if (eq sym 'x) (cc2) (cc3)))

;;; So this expansion has avoided inserting the s-expression CC1 more than once,
;;; but it inserts CC2 and CC3 each twice.  If those are not self-evaluating
;;; literals, then we should further merge (0 1) with (2). Doing the second
;;; merge lumps everything into 1 bin which is as bad as, if not worse than,
;;; a chain if IF expressions testing the original symbol.
;;; i.e. bin merging could make the hashing operation pointless.

;;; Option (III)
;;; Use a "two-stage" decode.
;;; This makes the consequent of the inner case side-effect free,
;;; but is probably not great for performance, though is an elegant
;;; rendition of the equivalence class technique.

;;;
;;; HASH-FUN is taken as an argument mainly for testing purposes so that any
;;; behavior can be simulated without having to bother with finding symbols
;;; whose SXHASH hashes collide.
;;;
;;; FIXME: If not a perfect hash, then the best choice should be informed by a
;;; cost function that takes into account which symbols share a clause of the
;;; CASE form. Prefer collisions on symbols whose consequent in the CASE
;;; is the same, otherwise the expansion becomes convoluted.
