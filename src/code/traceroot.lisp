  "Find roots keeping the targets of WEAK-POINTERS alive.

WEAK-POINTERS must be a single SB-EXT:WEAK-POINTER or a list of those,
pointing to objects for which roots should be searched.

GC controls whether the search is performed in the context of a
garbage collection, that is with all Lisp threads stopped. Possible
values are:

  T
    This is the more accurate of the object liveness proof generators,
    as there is no chance for other code to execute in between the
    garbage collection and production of the chain of referencing
    objects.

  NIL
    This works well enough, but might be adversely affected by actions
    of concurrent threads.

CRITERION determines just how rooty (how deep) a root must be in order
to be considered. Possible values are:

  :OLDEST
     This says we can stop upon seeing an object in the oldest gen to
     GC, or older. This is the easiest test to satisfy.

  :PSEUDO-STATIC
     This is usually the same as :OLDEST, unless the oldest gen to GC
     has been decreased.

  :STATIC
     To find a root of an image-backed object, you want to stop only at
     a truly :STATIC object.

IGNORE is a list of objects to treat as if nonexistent in the heap.
It can often be useful for finding a path to an interned symbol other than
through its package by specifying the package as an ignored object.

PRINT controls whether discovered paths should be returned or
printed. Possible values are

  :VERBOSE
    Return no values. Print discovered paths using a verbose format
    with each node of each path on a separate line.

  true (other than :VERBOSE)
    Return no values. Print discovered paths using a compact format
    with all nodes of each path on a single line.

  NIL
    Do not print any output. Instead return the discovered paths as a
    list of lists. Each list has the form

      (TARGET . (ROOT NODE*))

    where TARGET is one of the target of one of the WEAK-POINTERS.

    ROOT is a description of the root at which the path starts and has
    one of the following forms:

      :STATIC
        If the root of the path is a non-collectible heap object.

      :PINNED
        If an unknown thread stack pins the root of the path.

      ((THREAD-NAME | THREAD-OBJECT) SYMBOL CURRENTP)
        If the path begins at a special binding of SYMBOL in a
        thread. CURRENTP is a BOOLEAN indicating whether the value is
        current or shadowed by another binding.

      ((THREAD-NAME | THREAD-OBJECT) GUESSED-PC)
        If the path begins at a lexical variable in the function whose
        code contains GUESSED-PC.

    Each NODE in the remainder of the path is a cons (OBJECT . SLOT)
    indicating that the slot at index SLOT in OBJECT references the
    next path node.
