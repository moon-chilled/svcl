;;; Quasi-lockfree concurrent hashtable
;;; ===================================

;; References:
;;  http://trac.clozure.com/ccl/wiki/Internals/LockFreeHashTables
;;  https://github.com/boundary/high-scale-lib/blob/master/src/main/java/org/cliffc/high_scale_lib/NonBlockingHashMap.java

;; The basic hashable is a lightweight one using prime number sizing strategy,
;; and a secondary hash for re-probing that is not necessarily co-prime with
;; the table size (as it would be, ideally), and no support for deletion.

;; The lock-free logic differs from each of the preceding reference algorithms.
;; The Java algorithm is truly lock-free: death of any thread will never impede
;; progress in other threads. The CCL algorithm is only quasi-lock-free, as is
;; ours. Were a rehashing thread to terminate abnormally while holding the
;; rehash mutex, all other threads will likely starve at some point.
;;
;; Unlike the CCL algorithm, we allow reading/writing concurrently with rehash.
;; Most operations will never notice that the rehasher has acquired a mutex,
;; because the only case where writers compete for the mutex is in trying
;; to claim a new cell in a storage vector that is being transported, and where
;; the rehasher has already visited the desired cell. Since the rehasher will
;; never re-visit a cell, it disallows updates that it could not perceive.
;; The Java algorithm has additional complexity imposed upon it by the
;; feature that rehashing work is parceling out fairly to threads,
;; whereas we avoid that by having one rehasher transport all cells.

;; A marker for cells that may be claimed by a writer
