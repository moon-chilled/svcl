  "Arrange for the designated FUNCTION to be called when there
are no more references to OBJECT, including references in
FUNCTION itself.

If DONT-SAVE is true, the finalizer will be cancelled when
SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE is called: this is useful for finalizers
deallocating system memory, which might otherwise be called
with addresses from the old image.

In a multithreaded environment FUNCTION may be called in any
thread. In both single and multithreaded environments FUNCTION
may be called in any dynamic scope: consequences are unspecified
if FUNCTION is not fully re-entrant.

Errors from FUNCTION are handled and cause a WARNING to be
signalled in whichever thread the FUNCTION was called in.

;;; This is a display produced by annotating parts of gc-common.c and
;;; interrupt.c with each thread's output in its own column.
;;; The main thread is on the right.

;;; This output shows that if the finalizer thread calls a function that
;;; triggers a GC, the interrupt nesting depth can grow without limit.
;;; The finalizer thread does not have to be a memory hog - it just has
;;; to be unlucky enough to be the thread that triggers the collection.
;;; _Any_ thread can bring the GC trigger up to the threshold,
;;; and as long as the finalizer thread is the one to cross the
;;; the threshold, it is tasked with triggering the next scan
;;; of finalizers, but it MUST NOT do so recursively.
;;;
;;; The same thing can happen without using a finalizer thread,
;;; but it's actually easier to understand the output this way.
