;;; This is a vaguely case-like macro that does number cross-product
;;; dispatches. The Vars are the variables we are dispatching off of.
;;; The Type paired with each Var is used in the error message when no
;;; case matches. Each case specifies a Type for each var, and is
;;; executed when that signature holds. A type may be a list
;;; (FOREACH Each-Type*), causing that case to be repeatedly
;;; instantiated for every Each-Type. In the body of each case, any
;;; list of the form (DISPATCH-TYPE Var-Name) is substituted with the
;;; type of that var in that instance of the case.
;;;
;;; [Though it says "_any_ list", it's still an example of how not to perform
;;; incomplete lexical analysis within a macro imho. Let's say that the body
;;; code passes a lambda that happens name its args DISPATCH-TYPE and X.
;;; What happens?
;;; (macroexpand-1 '(number-dispatch ((x number))
;;;                  ((float) (f x (lambda (dispatch-type x) (wat))))))
;;; -> [stuff elided]
;;;      (TYPECASE X (FLOAT (F X (LAMBDA FLOAT (WAT))))
;;;
;;; So the NUMBER-DISPATCH macro indeed substituted for *any* appearance
;;; just like it says. I wonder if we could define DISPATCH-TYPE as macrolet
;;; that expands to the type for the current branch, so that it _must_
;;; be in a for-evaluation position; but maybe I'm missing something?]
;;;
;;; As an alternate to a case spec, there may be a form whose CAR is a
;;; symbol. In this case, we apply the CAR of the form to the CDR and
;;; treat the result of the call as a list of cases. This process is
;;; not applied recursively.
;;;
;;; Be careful when using non-disjoint types in different cases for the
;;; same variable. Some uses will behave as intended, others not, as the
;;; variables are dispatched off sequentially and clauses are reordered
;;; for efficiency. Some, but not all, problematic cases are detected
;;; and lead to a compile time error; see GENERATE-NUMBER-DISPATCH above
;;; for an example.
