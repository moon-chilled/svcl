;;;; structure frobbing primitives

;;; For lack of any better to place to write up some detail surrounding
;;; layout creation for structure types, I'm putting here.
;;; When you issue a DEFSTRUCT at the REPL, there are *three* instances
;;; of LAYOUT makde for the new structure.
;;; 1) The first is one associated with a temporary instance of
;;; structure-classoid used in parsing the DEFSTRUCT form so that
;;; we don't signal an UNKNOWN-TYPE condition for something like:
;;;   (defstruct chain (next nil :type (or null chain)).
;;; The temporary classoid is garbage immediately after parsing
;;; and is never installed.
;;; 2) The next is the actual LAYOUT that ends up being registered.
;;; 3) The third is a layout created when setting the "compiler layout"
;;; which contains copies of the length/depthoid/inherits etc
;;; that we compare against the installed one to make sure they match.
;;; The third one also gets thrown away.
