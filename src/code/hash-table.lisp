;;; Our table representation is as illustrated below.
;;; SIZE is always the exact number of K/V entries that can be stored,
;;; and can be any number, not necessarily a power of 2.

;;;            __________________________________________
;;;  K/V       |                                    |   |
;;;  vector    | * | * |  K | V | K | V | ......... | * |
;;;            +________________________________________+
;;;                    | <---       SIZE         -->|
;;;
;;;                      ^--- pair index 1 and so on
;;;

;;; The length of PAIRS (the K/V vector) is the specified :SIZE * 2
;;; plus 3 elements of overhead, 2 at the beginning and one at the end.
;;; (It's slighly strange that extra cells are in two different places,
;;; however there's a reason: we need an indicator for the end of a chain,
;;; and/or unused bin, and we use 0 for that, which means that k/v pair 0
;;; is unusable. But we can't keep indiscriminately adding overhead cells
;;; to the front because that make even more k/v pairs unusable,
;;; whereas adding at the end doesn't cause any such problem)
;;; Pair index 1 is the first pair that stores user data.

;;; The length of the HASH-VECTOR is in direct correspondence with the
;;; physical k/v cells, so that we can store a hash per key and not worry
;;; about one wasted cell. (i.e. the 0th k/v cell can't be used, so neither
;;; can the 0th hash value. To avoid this 1 cell of waste would mean adding
;;; and subtracting 1 here and there, needlessly complicating things)

;;; The INDEX vector is the traditional power-of-2 sized vector mapping a hash
;;; value to a pair. These are what you might calls the "bins" or "buckets" of
;;; the table. The value in a bin is the pair index of the start of the chain
;;; belonging to the bin. The value is 1..SIZE or 0 for an empty bin, which works
;;; well because pair index 0 isn't usable. The NEXT vector is the pointer to
;;; follow from a pair index to the next pair index in the same chain. As with
;;; the hash vector, the NEXT vector is sized at 1 greater than minimally
;;; necessary, to avoid adding and subtracting 1 from a pair index.

;;; The PAIRS vector has an odd length with the following overhead elements:
;;;
;;; [0] = high-water-mark
;;; [1] = rehash-due-to-GC indicator
;;; ...
;;; [length-1] = auxiliary info depending on kind of table
;;;   See KV-VECTOR-AUX-INFO in 'target-hash-table'

;;; HASH-TABLE is implemented as a STRUCTURE-OBJECT.
