;;;; is the first to exercise the type machinery. This stuff is also
;;;; somewhat implementation-dependent in that implementations may
;;;; want to precompute other types which are important to them.

;; We want to assign SAETP-CTYPE for each SAETP instance, but we can't do it
;; just yet because CHARACTER and FIXNUM are not acceptable to SPECIFIER-TYPE.
;; The reason they're not is that each is a builtin classoid with a translation
;; that can be given to SPECIFIER-TYPE as it has a translator:
;;  CHARACTER =  (CHARACTER-SET)
;;  FIXNUM = `(INTEGER ,MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM ,MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM)
;; but the classoid's TRANSLATION slot isn't set yet.
;; So ideally we could commence with the loop over *builtin-classoids*
;; assigning each their translation, and then come back to filling in SAETP-CTYPE.
;; That's where we hit a circularity: You can't parse BIT-VECTOR because while we
;; know that it's (ARRAY BIT (*)), in order to parse (ARRAY <x>) you have to call
;; %UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE with the parse of <x>, looking for the first SAETP
;; whosed -CTYPE is a supertype of <x>. But the SAETP-CTYPEs aren't filled in!
;; The solution I favor is to process CHARACTER and FIXNUM in *builtin-classoids*,
;; then assign all SAETP-CTYPES, then do the rest of *builtin-classoids*.

;;; call on unknown types. This relied upon the knowledge that

;;; condition while in cold-init. This is terrible! It means that
;;; (a) we have to know that something wouldn't signal
;;;     when it otherwise should, and
;;; (b) we can call that thing when the very data that it depends on
;;;     are actually wrong.
;;; Well, in as much as we have to do this suspicious action,
;;; at least let's not get into a state where we *know*
;;; that it ought to signal.
