;;; on each loop iteration because PUTHASH could assign a new vector at any time.
;;; It no longer will, provided that the restriction against mutating a table
;;; (other than the current key) during traversal is obeyed. Even if violated,
;;; the k/v vector won't shrink. But in any case, we grab the vector once only.
;;; There are AVERs in the insertion code that the high water mark remains valid.
