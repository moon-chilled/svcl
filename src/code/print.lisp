;;;; circularity detection stuff

;;; When *PRINT-CIRCLE* is T, this gets bound to a hash table that
;;; (eventually) ends up with entries for every object printed. When
;;; we are initially looking for circularities, we enter a T when we
;;; find an object for the first time, and a 0 when we encounter an
;;; object a second time around. When we are actually printing, the 0
;;; entries get changed to the actual marker value when they are first
;;; printed.
(defvar *circularity-hash-table* nil)

;;; When NIL, we are just looking for circularities. After we have
;;; found them all, this gets bound to 0. Then whenever we need a new
;;; marker, it is incremented.
(defvar *circularity-counter* nil)

;;; Check to see whether OBJECT is a circular reference, and return
;;; something non-NIL if it is. If ASSIGN is true, reference
;;; bookkeeping will only be done for existing entries, no new
;;; references will be recorded. If ASSIGN is true, then the number to
;;; use in the #n= and #n# noise is assigned at this time.
;;;
;;; Note: CHECK-FOR-CIRCULARITY must be called *exactly* once with
;;; ASSIGN true, or the circularity detection noise will get confused
;;; about when to use #n= and when to use #n#. If this returns non-NIL
;;; when ASSIGN is true, then you must call HANDLE-CIRCULARITY on it.
;;; If CHECK-FOR-CIRCULARITY returns :INITIATE as the second value,
;;; you need to initiate the circularity detection noise, e.g. bind
;;; *CIRCULARITY-HASH-TABLE* and *CIRCULARITY-COUNTER* to suitable values
;;; (see #'OUTPUT-OBJECT for an example).
;;;
;;; Circularity detection is done in two places, OUTPUT-OBJECT and
;;; WITH-CIRCULARITY-DETECTION (which is used from PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK).
;;; These checks aren't really redundant (at least I can't really see
;;; a clean way of getting by with the checks in only one of the places).
;;; This causes problems when mixed with pprint-dispatching; an object is
;;; marked as visited in OUTPUT-OBJECT, dispatched to a pretty printer
;;; that uses PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK (directly or indirectly), leading to
;;; output like #1=#1#. The MODE parameter is used for detecting and

;;;; float printing

;;; FLONUM-TO-STRING (and its subsidiary function FLOAT-STRING) does
;;; most of the work for all printing of floating point numbers in
;;; FORMAT.  It converts a floating point number to a string in a free
;;; or fixed format with no exponent. The interpretation of the
;;; arguments is as follows:
;;;
;;;     X       - The floating point number to convert, which must not be
;;;             negative.
;;;     WIDTH    - The preferred field width, used to determine the number
;;;             of fraction digits to produce if the FDIGITS parameter
;;;             is unspecified or NIL. If the non-fraction digits and the
;;;             decimal point alone exceed this width, no fraction digits
;;;             will be produced unless a non-NIL value of FDIGITS has been
;;;             specified. Field overflow is not considerd an error at this
;;;             level.
;;;     FDIGITS  - The number of fractional digits to produce. Insignificant
;;;             trailing zeroes may be introduced as needed. May be
;;;             unspecified or NIL, in which case as many digits as possible
;;;             are generated, subject to the constraint that there are no
;;;             trailing zeroes.
;;;     SCALE    - If this parameter is specified or non-NIL, then the number
;;;             printed is (* x (expt 10 scale)). This scaling is exact,
;;;             and cannot lose precision.
;;;     FMIN     - This parameter, if specified or non-NIL, is the minimum
;;;             number of fraction digits which will be produced, regardless
;;;             of the value of WIDTH or FDIGITS. This feature is used by
;;;             the ~E format directive to prevent complete loss of
;;;             significance in the printed value due to a bogus choice of
;;;             scale factor.
;;;
;;; Returns:
;;; (VALUES DIGIT-STRING DIGIT-LENGTH LEADING-POINT TRAILING-POINT DECPNT)
;;; where the results have the following interpretation:
;;;
;;;     DIGIT-STRING    - The decimal representation of X, with decimal point.
;;;     DIGIT-LENGTH    - The length of the string DIGIT-STRING.
;;;     LEADING-POINT   - True if the first character of DIGIT-STRING is the
;;;                    decimal point.
;;;     TRAILING-POINT  - True if the last character of DIGIT-STRING is the
;;;                    decimal point.
;;;     POINT-POS       - The position of the digit preceding the decimal
;;;                    point. Zero indicates point before first digit.
;;;
;;; NOTE: FLONUM-TO-STRING goes to a lot of trouble to guarantee
;;; accuracy. Specifically, the decimal number printed is the closest
;;; possible approximation to the true value of the binary number to
;;; be printed from among all decimal representations with the same
;;; number of digits. In free-format output, i.e. with the number of
;;; digits unconstrained, it is guaranteed that all the information is
;;; preserved, so that a properly- rounding reader can reconstruct the
;;; original binary number, bit-for-bit, from its printed decimal
;;; representation. Furthermore, only as many digits as necessary to
;;; satisfy this condition will be printed.
;;;
;;; FLOAT-DIGITS actually generates the digits for positive numbers;
;;; see below for comments.

;;;; entry point for the float printer

;;; the float printer as called by PRINT, PRIN1, PRINC, etc. The
;;; argument is printed free-format, in either exponential or
;;; non-exponential notation, depending on its magnitude.
;;;
;;; NOTE: When a number is to be printed in exponential format, it is
;;; scaled in floating point. Since precision may be lost in this
;;; process, the guaranteed accuracy properties of FLONUM-TO-STRING
;;; are lost. The difficulty is that FLONUM-TO-STRING performs
;;; extensive computations with integers of similar magnitude to that
;;; of the number being printed. For large exponents, the bignums
;;; really get out of hand. If bignum arithmetic becomes reasonably
;;; fast and the exponent range is not too large, then it might become
;;; attractive to handle exponential notation with the same accuracy
;;; as non-exponential notation, using the method described in the
;;; Steele and White paper.
;;;
;;; NOTE II: this has been bypassed slightly by implementing Burger
;;; and Dybvig, 1996.  When someone has time (KLUDGE) they can
;;; probably (a) implement the optimizations suggested by Burger and
;;; Dyvbig, and (b) remove all vestiges of Dragon4, including from
;;; fixed-format printing.
