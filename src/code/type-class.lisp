;;;; This file contains the definition of the CTYPE (Compiler TYPE)
;;;; structure, as well as the TYPE-CLASS structure which is a metaobject
;;;; that factors out commonality amongst the subtypes of CTYPE.
;;;; Together they form a sort of mini object system with slightly
;;;; odd dispatching rules. The TYPE-CLASS is a vtable, essentially.
;;;; Various macros related to manipulating those things are here too.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for

  ;;     Instead the wrapper functions TYPE-UNION2, TYPE-INTERSECTION2,
  ;;     TYPE-UNION, and TYPE-INTERSECTION handle those cases specially
