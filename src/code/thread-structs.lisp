;;; It's possible to make futex/non-futex switchable at runtime by ensuring that
;;; these synchronization primitive structs contain all the slots for the union
;;; of any kind of backing object.  Some of the #+sb-futex/#-sb-futex cases in
;;; target-thread also have to be changed to a COND rather than a compile-time test.
;;; Among the uses of this would be to test real posix mutexes (with a finalizer on
;;; each lisp-side proxy) or support older C APIs. Posix mutexes work nicely now
;;; because finalizers are more efficient than they were, and when many threads
;;; compete for a mutex, the pthread code seems to do a better job at reducing
;;; cycles spent in the OS.

  ;; This is one of a few different views of a lisp thread:

  ;;     with the SB-VM::THREAD primitive object
  ;;  3. a pthread, which may reside anywhere, possibly the high end of the lisp stack
  ;;     (above the SP given to your entrypoint), whatever the pthread library chooses.
  ;;  4. the THREAD instance (this structure)
  ;; This value is 0 if the thread is not considered alive, though the pthread
  ;; may be running its termination code (unlinking from all_threads etc)
  (primitive-thread 0 :type sb-vm:word)
  ;; This is a redundant copy of the pthread identifier from the primitive thread.
  ;; It's needed in the SB-THREAD:THREAD as well because there are valid reasons to
  ;; manipulate the new thread before it has assigned 'th->os_thread = pthread_self()'.
  ;; While we always have access to the C struct thread from Lisp, apparently the C
  ;; code can't pass "&th->os_thread" as the first argument to pthread_create() for the
  ;; incredible reason that the word might be written *after* the memory pointed at
  ;; by 'th' has already been freed. Such action might seem to violate:
  ;;  "Before returning, a successful call to pthread_create() stores the ID of the
  ;;   new thread in the buffer pointed to by thread"
  ;;  (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html)
  ;; but that's not exactly what POSIX says, which is only:
  ;;  "Upon successful completion, pthread_create() stores the ID of the created thread
  ;;   in the location referenced by thread."
  ;; (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_create.html)
  ;; so there seems to be some leeway, and linux + glibc provides more of a guarantee.
  ;; Technically we should have only one authoritative source of the pthread identifier,
  ;; but it's not too critical, it's just annoying that there are two sources of
  ;; the same value.
  ;; The slot is somewhat poorly named (for consistency with C) because though it may
  ;; correspond to an OS thread, it could be the case that the threading model has
  ;; user-visible threads that do not map directly to OSs threads (or LWPs).
