;;; method function stuff.
;;;
;;; PCL historically included a so-called method-fast-function, which
;;; is essentially a method function but with (a) a precomputed
;;; continuation for CALL-NEXT-METHOD and (b) a permutation vector for
;;; slot access.  [ FIXME: see if we can understand these two
;;; optimizations before commit. ]  However, the presence of the
;;; fast-function meant that we violated AMOP and the effect of the
;;; :FUNCTION initarg, and furthermore got to potentially confusing
;;; situations where the function and the fast-function got out of
;;; sync, so that calling (method-function method) with the defined
;;; protocol would do different things from (call-method method) in
;;; method combination.
;;;
;;; So we define this internal method function structure, which we use
;;; when we create a method function ourselves.  This means that we
;;; can hang the various bits of information that we want off the
;;; method function itself, and also that if a user overrides method
;;; function creation there is no danger of having the system get
;;; confused.
