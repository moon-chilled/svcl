The CommonLoops evaluator is meta-circular.

Most of the code in PCL is methods on generic functions, including
most of the code that actually implements generic functions and method
lookup.

So, we have a classic bootstrapping problem. The solution to this is
to first get a cheap implementation of generic functions running,
these are called early generic functions. These early generic
functions and the corresponding early methods and early method lookup
are used to get enough of the system running that it is possible to
create real generic functions and methods and implement real method
lookup. At that point (done in the file FIXUP) the function
!FIX-EARLY-GENERIC-FUNCTIONS is called to convert all the early generic
functions to real generic functions.

The cheap generic functions are built using the same
FUNCALLABLE-INSTANCE objects that real generic functions are made out of.
This means that as PCL is being bootstrapped, the cheap generic
function objects which are being created are the same objects which
will later be real generic functions. This is good because:
  - we don't cons garbage structure, and
  - we can keep pointers to the cheap generic function objects
    during booting because those pointers will still point to
    the right object after the generic functions are all fixed up.

This file defines the DEFMETHOD macro and the mechanism used to expand
it. This includes the mechanism for processing the body of a method.
DEFMETHOD basically expands into a call to LOAD-DEFMETHOD, which
basically calls ADD-METHOD to add the method to the generic function.
These expansions can be loaded either during bootstrapping or when PCL
is fully up and running.

An important effect of this arrangement is it means we can compile
files with DEFMETHOD forms in them in a completely running PCL, but
then load those files back in during bootstrapping. This makes
development easier. It also means there is only one set of code for
processing DEFMETHOD. Bootstrapping works by being sure to have
LOAD-METHOD be careful to call only primitives which work during
bootstrapping.

;;; calling accessor methods -- we call GET-GENERIC-FUN-INFO when
;;; computing discriminating functions, so we need to be careful about
;;; having a base case for the recursion, and we provide that with the
;;; STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION case below.  However, we are not (yet)
;;; as disciplined as CLISP's CLOS/MOP, and it would be nice to get to
;;; that stage, where all potentially dangerous cases are enumerated
