;;;; Generic conditional VOPs

;;; The generic conditional branch, emitted immediately after test
;;; VOPs that only set flags.
;;;
;;; FLAGS is a list of condition descriptors. If the first descriptor
;;; is CL:NOT, the test was true if all the remaining conditions are
;;; false. Otherwise, the test was true if any of the conditions is.
;;;
;;; NOT-P flips the meaning of the test, as with regular :CONDITIONAL
;;; VOP. If NOT-P is true, the code must branch to dest if the test was
;;; false. Otherwise, the code must branch to dest if the test was true.
