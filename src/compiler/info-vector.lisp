(in-package "SB-IMPL")

;;;; This file implements abstract types which map globaldb Info-Number/Name
;;;; pairs to data values. The database itself is defined in 'globaldb'.

;;;; Info-Vectors
;;;; ============

;;; Info for a Name (an arbitrary object) is stored in an Info-Vector,
;;; which is like is a 2-level association list. Info-Vectors are stored in
;;; symbols for most names, or in the global hashtable for "complicated" names.

;;; Such vectors exists in two variations: packed and unpacked.
;;; The representations are nearly equivalent for lookup, but the packed format
;;; is more space-efficient, though difficult to manipulate except by unpacking.

;;; Consider a family of Names whose "root" is SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS.
;;;  1. SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS
;;;  2. (SETF SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS)
;;;  3. (CAS SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS)
;;;
;;; Those three names share one Info-Vector. Conceptually the outer alist key
;;; is NIL for the first of those names, and SETF/CAS for the latter two.
;;; The inner alist key is a number identifying a type of info.
;;; If it were actually an alist, it would look like this:
;;;
;;;  ((nil  (63 . #<fdefn SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS>) (1 . :FUNCTION) ...)
;;;   (SETF (63 . #<fdefn (SETF SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS)>) ...)
;;;   (CAS  (63 . #<fdefn (CAS SB-MOP:STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS)>) ...)
;;;   ...)
;;;
;;; Note:
;;; * The root name is exogenous to the vector - it is not stored.
;;; * The info-number for (:FUNCTION :DEFINITION) is 63, :KIND is 1, etc.
;;; * Names which are lists of length other than 2, or improper lists,
;;;   or whose elements are not both symbols, are disqualified.

;;; Packed format
;;; -------------
;;; Because the keys to the inner lists are integers in the range 0 to 63,
;;; either 5 or 10 keys will fit into a fixnum depending on word size.
;;; This permits one memory read to retrieve a collection of keys. In packed
;;; format, an ordered set of keys ("fields") is called a "descriptor".
;;;
;;; Descriptors are stored from element 0 upward in the packed-info,
;;; and data are indexed downward from the last element.
;;;
;;;  [descriptor0 descriptor1 ... descriptorN valueN ... value1 value0]
;;;
;;; e.g. The field at absolute index 3 (physical element 0, bit position 18)
;;; will find its data at index (- END 3).  In this manner, it doesn't matter
;;; how many more descriptors exist.

;;; A "group" comprises all the info for a particular Name, and its list
;;; of types may may span descriptors, though rarely.
;;; An "auxiliary key" is the first element of a 2-list Name. It is interposed
;;; within the data portion of the packed-info after the preceding info group.
;;; Descriptors are self-delimiting in that the first field in a group
;;; indicates the number of additional fields in the group.

;;; Unpacked format
;;; ---------------
;;; This representation is used transiently during insertion/deletion.
;;; It is a concatenation of plists as a vector, interposing at the splice
;;; points the auxiliary key for the group, except for the root name which
;;; does not store an auxiliary key.
;;;
;;; Unpacked vector format looks like:
;;;
;;;                                 /- next group starts here
;;;                                 v
;;;  #(length type val type val ... KEY length type val ... KEY length ...)
;;;    ^
;;;    info group for the primary Name, a/k/a "root symbol", starts here
;;;
;;; One can envision that the first info group stores its auxiliary key
;;; at vector index -1 when thinking about the correctness of algorithms
;;; that process unpacked info-vectors.
;;; See TEST-PACKIFY-INFOS for examples of each format.
