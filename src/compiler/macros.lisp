;;;; DEFTYPEs

;;; An INLINEP value describes how a function is called. The values
;;; have these meanings:
;;;     NIL     No declaration seen: do whatever you feel like, but don't
;;;             dump an inline expansion.
;;; NOTINLINE  NOTINLINE declaration seen: always do full function call.
;;;    INLINE  INLINE declaration seen: save expansion, expanding to it
;;;             if policy favors.
;;; MAYBE-INLINE
;;;             Retain expansion, but only use it opportunistically.
;;;             MAYBE-INLINE is quite different from INLINE. As explained
;;;             by APD on #lisp 2005-11-26: "MAYBE-INLINE lambda is
;;;             instantiated once per component, INLINE - for all
;;;             references (even under #'without FUNCALL)."

;;;; source-hacking defining forms

;;; Parse a DEFMACRO-style lambda-list, setting things up so that a
;;; compiler error happens if the syntax is invalid.
;;;
;;; Define a function that converts a special form or other magical
;;; thing into IR1. LAMBDA-LIST is a defmacro style lambda
;;; list. START-VAR, NEXT-VAR and RESULT-VAR are bound to the start and
;;; result continuations for the resulting IR1. KIND is the function
;;; kind to associate with NAME.
;;; FIXME - Translators which accept implicit PROGNs fail on improper
;;; input, e.g. (LAMBDA (X) (CATCH X (BAZ) . 3))
;;; This is because &REST is defined to allow a dotted tail in macros,
;;; and we have no implementation-specific workaround to disallow it.

;;;
;;; Define a macro-like source-to-source transformation for the
;;; function NAME. A source transform may "pass" by returning a
;;; non-nil second value. If the transform passes, then the form is
;;; converted as a normal function call. If the supplied arguments are
;;; not compatible with the specified LAMBDA-LIST, then the transform
;;; automatically passes.
;;;
;;; Source transforms may only be defined for functions. Source
;;; transformation is not attempted if the function is declared
;;; NOTINLINE. Source transforms should not examine their arguments.
;;; A macro lambda list which destructures more than one level would
;;; be legal but suspicious, as inner list parsing "examines" arguments.
;;; If it matters how the function is used, then DEFTRANSFORM should
;;; be used to define an IR1 transformation.
;;;
;;; If the desirability of the transformation depends on the current
;;; OPTIMIZE parameters, then the POLICY macro should be used to
;;; determine when to pass.
;;;
;;; Note that while a compiler-macro must deal with being invoked when its
;;; whole form matches (FUNCALL <f> ...) so that it must skip over <f> to find
;;; the arguments, a source-transform need not worry about that situation.
;;; Any FUNCALL which is eligible for a source-transform calls the expander
;;; with the form's head replaced by a compiler representation of the function.
;;; Internalizing the name avoids semantic problems resulting from syntactic
;;; substitution. One problem would be that a source-transform can exist for
;;; a function named (SETF X), but ((SETF X) arg ...) would be bad syntax.
;;; Even if we decided that it is ok within the compiler - just not in code
;;; given to the compiler - the problem remains that changing (FUNCALL 'F x)
;;; to (F x) is wrong when F also names a local functionoid.
;;; Hence, either a #<GLOBAL-VAR> or #<DEFINED-FUN> appears in the form head.

;;;; DEFTRANSFORM

;;; Define an IR1 transformation for NAME. An IR1 transformation
;;; computes a lambda that replaces the function variable reference
;;; for the call. A transform may pass (decide not to transform the
;;; call) by calling the GIVE-UP-IR1-TRANSFORM function. LAMBDA-LIST
;;; both determines how the current call is parsed and specifies the
;;; LAMBDA-LIST for the resulting lambda.
;;;
;;; We parse the call and bind each of the lambda-list variables to
;;; the lvar which represents the value of the argument. When parsing
;;; the call, we ignore the defaults, and always bind the variables
;;; for unsupplied arguments to NIL. If a required argument is
;;; missing, an unknown keyword is supplied, or an argument keyword is
;;; not a constant, then the transform automatically passes. The
;;; DECLARATIONS apply to the bindings made by DEFTRANSFORM at
;;; transformation time, rather than to the variables of the resulting
;;; lambda. Bound-but-not-referenced warnings are suppressed for the
;;; lambda-list variables. The DOC-STRING is used when printing
;;; efficiency notes about the defined transform.
;;;
;;; Normally, the body evaluates to a form which becomes the body of
;;; an automatically constructed lambda. We make LAMBDA-LIST the
;;; lambda-list for the lambda, and automatically insert declarations
;;; of the argument and result types. If the second value of the body
;;; is non-null, then it is a list of declarations which are to be
;;; inserted at the head of the lambda. Automatic lambda generation
;;; may be inhibited by explicitly returning a lambda from the body.
;;;
;;; The ARG-TYPES and RESULT-TYPE are used to create a function type
;;; which the call must satisfy before transformation is attempted.
;;; The function type specifier is constructed by wrapping (FUNCTION
;;; ...) around these values, so the lack of a restriction may be
;;; specified by omitting the argument or supplying *. The argument
;;; syntax specified in the ARG-TYPES need not be the same as that in
;;; the LAMBDA-LIST, but the transform will never happen if the
;;; syntaxes can't be satisfied simultaneously. If there is an
;;; existing transform for the same function that has the same type,
;;; then it is replaced with the new definition.
;;;
;;; These are the legal keyword options:
;;;   :RESULT - A variable which is bound to the result lvar.
;;;   :NODE   - A variable which is bound to the combination node for the call.
;;;   :POLICY - A form which is supplied to the POLICY macro to determine
;;;             whether this transformation is appropriate. If the result
;;;             is false, then the transform automatically gives up.
;;;   :DEFUN-ONLY
;;;           - Don't actually instantiate a transform, instead just DEFUN
;;;             Name with the specified transform definition function. This
;;;             may be later instantiated with %DEFTRANSFORM.
;;;   :INFO   - an extra piece of information the transform receives,
;;;             typically for use with :DEFUN-ONLY
;;;   :IMPORTANT
;;;           - If the transform fails and :IMPORTANT is
;;;               NIL,       then never print an efficiency note.
;;;               :SLIGHTLY, then print a note if SPEED>INHIBIT-WARNINGS.
;;;               T,         then print a note if SPEED>=INHIBIT-WARNINGS.
;;;             :SLIGHTLY is the default.

In trying to figure out whether we can rectify the totally unobvious behavior
that FUN-INFO-TRANSFORMS are tried in the reverse order of their definitions,
it is helpful to understand when multiple transforms exist where more than
one could be selected.
In the absence of type overlap, it wouldn't matter what order they were attempted.
Unfortunately there are plenty of cases where the _least_ _specific_ fun-type
should be attempted first, which at least superfically makes no sense at all.
