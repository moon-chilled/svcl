;;; Tags for the main low-level types are stored in the low n (usually three)
;;; bits to identify the type of a machine word.  Certain constraints
;;; apply:
;;;   * EVEN-FIXNUM-LOWTAG and ODD-FIXNUM-LOWTAG must be 0 and 4: code
;;;     which shifts left two places to convert raw integers to tagged
;;;     fixnums is ubiquitous.
;;;   * LIST-POINTER-LOWTAG + N-WORD-BYTES = OTHER-POINTER-LOWTAG: NIL
;;;     is both a cons and a symbol (at the same address) and depends on this.
;;;     See the definition of SYMBOL in objdef.lisp
;;;   * OTHER-IMMEDIATE-0-LOWTAG are spaced 4 apart: various code wants to
;;;     iterate through these.  (This is not true on PPC64)
;;; (These are just the ones we know about as of sbcl-0.7.1.22. There
;;; might easily be more, since these values have stayed highly
;;; constrained for more than a decade, an inviting target for
;;; inventive abstraction-phobic maintainers.:-)
;;;
;;; Another way to look at lowtags is that there is no one lowtag
;;; length.  On 32-bit platforms, fixnums and other-immediates have a
;;; lowtag length of two bits, and pointers have a lowtag length of
;;; three bits.  On 64-bit platforms, fixnums and pointers gain an
;;; extra bit, and six "pad" lowtags waste the extra encoding space so
;;; obtained.
;;;
;;;  x00 -- fixnum
;;;  x10 -- other-immediate
;;;  001 -- instance-pointer
;;;  011 -- list-pointer
;;;  101 -- fun-pointer
;;;  111 -- other-pointer
;;;
;;; If you change the tag layout, check the various functions in
;;; src/runtime/runtime.h to see if they need to be updated, along
;;; with print_obj() in src/runtime/print.c, possibly 'late-objdef.lisp'
;;; and possibly the code in src/code/room.

;;; Note: the order specified here is not critical for correctness,

;;;
;;; However, for efficiency, we prefer contiguous sets of widetags for
;;; "similar" objects, so that type checking can be done with a range
;;; check, rather than several individual checks.
;;;
;;; * BIGNUM + RATIO (+ FIXNUM) = RATIONAL
;;;
;;; * SINGLE-FLOAT + DOUBLE-FLOAT + LONG-FLOAT = FLOAT
;;;   But: There's not a snowball's chance that #+long-float works.

;;; * RATIONAL + FLOAT = REAL
;;;
;;; * (FIXME: COMPLEX example, which needs fixing anyway -- see
;;;   UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE)
;;;
;;; * SIMPLE-ARRAY-* = (SIMPLE-ARRAY * (*))
;;;
;;; * SIMPLE-CHARACTER-STRING + SIMPLE-BASE-STRING = SIMPLE-STRING
;;;
;;; * SIMPLE-ARRAY + COMPLEX-ARRAYOID = (SATISFIES ARRAY-HEADER-P)
;;;
;;; In addition, with
;;; sufficient care we can cause extra combinations to appear with
;;; differences in only one bit, permitting a more efficient type
;;; test.  As an example, if SIMPLE-BASE-STRING = 0xA6 and
;;; COMPLEX-BASE-STRING = 0xE6, then the type test for BASE-STRING is
;;;
;;;   AND   tag, ~0x40, tag
;;;   ANDcc tag,  0xA6, tag
;;;   JNE   tag, label
;;;
;;; rather than two separate tests and jumps.
;;; However, the cases where this is possible are few, and I'm not sure if
;;; that happened before or after rearrangement of widetags in change 30eccf.
;;; At present on 64-bit target with unicode we have:
;;;   (logcount (logxor complex-character-string-widetag simple-character-string-widetag)) = 2
;;;   (logcount (logxor complex-base-string-widetag simple-base-string-widetag)) = 2
;;;   (logcount (logxor complex-bit-vector-widetag simple-bit-vector-widetag)) = 1
;;; and we have one winner.  The situation is slightly different for 32-bit.

;; FIXME: our nomenclature is baffling in more ways than implied by comments in
;; package-data-list regarding use of the word "complex" in both a numerical
;; sense and "non-simple" sense:
;; - There is no widetag specific to (AND (VECTOR T) (NOT SIMPLE-ARRAY)), i.e.
;; COMPLEX-VECTOR-WIDETAG is not the complex version of SIMPLE-VECTOR-WIDETAG
;; which is, in part, why the comment in x86/type-vops about optimizing a test
;; for (VECTOR T) is wrong.
;; - simple-array-nil should be named simple-rank-1-array-nil, though I think
;; simple-vector-nil is fine despite some reluctance to glue the particles
;; "simple" and "vector" together due to overtones of the standard meaning.
;; We could rename things that mean vector of wild type to VECTOR-*
;; and simple vector of T to SIMPLE-VECTOR-T. Just because CL says that
;; SIMPLE-VECTOR means the latter doesn't make it right for SBCL internals.
