;;;; KLUDGE: The primitive objects here may look like self-contained
;;;; definitions, but in general they're not. In particular, if you
;;;; try to add a slot to them, beware of the following:
;;;;   * The GC scavenging code (and for all I know other GC code too)
;;;;     is not automatically generated from these layouts, but instead
;;;;     was hand-written to correspond to them. The offsets are
;;;;     automatically propagated into the GC scavenging code, but the
;;;;     existence of slots, and whether they should be scavenged, is
;;;;     not automatically propagated. Thus e.g. if you add a
;;;;     SIMPLE-FUN-DEBUG-INFO slot holding a tagged object which needs
;;;;     to be GCed, you need to tweak scav_code_blob() and
;;;;     verify_space() in gencgc.c, and the corresponding code in gc.c.
;;;;   * Various code (e.g. STATIC-FSET in genesis.lisp) is hard-wired
;;;;     to know the name of the last slot of the object the code works
;;;;     with, and implicitly to know that the last slot is special (being
;;;;     the beginning of an arbitrary-length sequence of bytes following
;;;;     the fixed-layout slots).

Code header representation:

  |       total words     | widetag |
  | (3 bytes less 2 bits) |         |
  +-----------------------+---------+  [32-bit words]
  |      N boxed header bytes       |
  +---------------------------------+
  max total payload size in words = #x3fffff

  |            total words          | gc_gen | 0 | 0 | widetag |
  |            (4 bytes)            |        |   |   |         |
  +------------------------------------------------------------+  [64-bit words]
  |                                 |   N boxed header bytes   |
  |                                 |        (4 bytes)         |
  +------------------------------------------------------------+

  the two zero bytes are reserved for future use
  max total payload size in words = uint_max
    (should probably made the same as for 32-bit word size for consistency)

For both:
  code-size = total words * n-word-bytes - boxed bytes
  text-size = code-size - simple-fun table size - padding bytes
  bit 31 of word 0 = fullcgc mark bit
  bit 30           = touched since last GC bit
  The boxed byte count is stored "raw" (i.e. it's not a tagged value,
  but it has fixnum nature)

Since most architectures can not atomically store and load 2 words at once,
it is essential that code size be computable by loading a single word
to make backtrace reliable (i.e. in the heap search step).

Note that vector objects require reading their length from a non-header word,
but this not subject to a data race because only 1 word conveys the size.
In addition there are no vectors on code pages which are the pages scanned
during backtrace.
