;;; 4. The costs for this operand.
;;; 5. The load-scs vector for this operand (NIL if more-p.)
;;; 6. True if the costs or SCs in the VOP-INFO are inconsistent with

;;; Arrange boxed constants so that all :NAMED-CALL constants are first,

;;;  * FDEFNs which are referenced for call (versus for value as in #'FUN)
;;;    may be stored in the code header as untagged pointers. This benefits PPC64
;;;    because lowtag subtraction can't be had "for free" due to the architectural
;;;    requirement that lispword-aligned loads need a displacement that is
;;;    a multiple of 4, which OTHER-POINTER-LOWTAG does not satisfy.
;;;  * In the current approach for so-called "static" linking of immobile code,
;;;    we change code instruction bytes so that they call into a simple-fun
;;;    directly rather than through an fdefn, but the approach is subject to a
;;;    data race when redefining an fdefn. It's conceivable that the race can be
;;;    eliminated by substituting placeholders in the code headers of functions
;;;    that had static linking performed - so that they see a reference to the
;;;    callee rather than an fdefn - but in order for that to work, we must
;;;    distinguish between fdefns that are needed for FDEFN-FUN
;;;    (via IR2-CONVERT-GLOBAL-VAR) versus those which are present to satisfy
;;;    a GC invariant and are not otherwise actually used.
;;;  * Even without the preceding change, remove-static-links can avoid
;;;    scanning code constants that are not FDEFNs.
