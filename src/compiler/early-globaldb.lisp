;;; With #+compact-instance-header it is possible to represent a vector of N things
;;; in a structure using (ALIGN-UP (1+ N) 2) words of memory. This is a saving
;;; of 1 word on average when compared to SIMPLE-VECTOR which needs
;;; (ALIGN-UP (+ N 2) 2) words.  Granted that either might have a padding word,
;;; but I've observed 5% to 10% space reduction by eliminating one slot.
;;; Without compact-instance-header, we'e indifferent, in terms of space,
;;; as to whether this is an INSTANCE or a SIMPLE-VECTOR. For consistency,
;;; we use an INSTANCE regardless of presence of the compact-header feature.
;;; This makes assembly routines (e.g. CALL-SYMBOL) slightly less sensitive
;;; to the feature's absence.

;;; Since variable-length instances aren't portably a thing,
