optimization and type checking, but TRACE will not show recursive
calls. If the function object is bound to another name BAR, and FOO is
bound to another function, calls to FOO inside BAR will remain to be
recursive.

When disabled, internal references to a function FOO will be
considered ti be a call of a function, bound to the symbol at
run-time, which is less efficient. TRACE will show recursive calls. In
case of renaming described above, calls to FOO will not be recursive
and will refer to the new function, bound to FOO.")

;;; ALLOW-NON-RETURNING-TAIL-CALL unsupresses the supression of tail-call
;;; optimization of nil-returning functions.
;;;
;;; At present this is used only by the ARG-COUNT-ERROR function, but would be
;;; useful in similar functions whose sole purpose is to accept positional
;;; arguments, shaping them into keyword arguments with which to call ERROR.
;;; Generally any function tail-calling a nil-returning function remains on the
;;; stack to allow a debugger to see variables in the signaling frame.
;;; However ARG-COUNT-ERROR is not supposed to be visible.
;;; Techniques that evolved to address its invisibility were brittle:
;;; undocumented DEBUG versus SPEED policy-based decisions in TAIL-ANNOTATE,
;;; or inefficient (performing FIND-CALLER-FRAME before calling ERROR).
;;; Frobbing *STACK-TOP-HINT* seems no better than a declaration saying
;;; "do what I mean," as the latter at least produces a consistent backtrace
;;; between Lisp and ldb or gdb.
