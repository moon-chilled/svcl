;;; Do environment analysis on the code in COMPONENT. This involves
;;; various things:
;;;  1. Make an ENVIRONMENT structure for each non-LET LAMBDA, assigning
;;;     the LAMBDA-ENVIRONMENT for all LAMBDAs.
;;;  2. Find all values that need to be closed over by each
;;;     environment.
;;;  3. Scan the blocks in the component closing over non-local-exit
;;;     continuations.
;;;  4. Delete all non-top-level functions with no references. This
;;;     should only get functions with non-NULL kinds, since normal
;;;     functions are deleted when their references go to zero.

;;; NS added [in bea5b384106a6734a4b280a76e8ebdd4d51b5323]
;;;  ;; Why is that bad? Because this non-elimination of
;;;  ;; non-returning tail calls causes the XEP for FOO [to] appear in
;;;  ;; backtrace for (defun foo (x) (error "foo ~S" x)) w[h]ich seems
;;;  ;; less then optimal. --NS 2005-02-28
