;;; Singly-linked queue with compare-and-swap operations.
;;;
;;; The following invariants hold except during updates:
;;;
;;;   (car (queue-head queue)) == +dummy+
;;;
;;;   (cdr (queue-tail queue)) == nil
;;;
;;;   If the queue is empty, (queue-head queue) == (queue-tail queue).
;;;
;;;   If the queue is non-empty, (cadr (queue-head queue)) is the next
;;;   value to be dequeued and (car (queue-tail queue)) is the most
;;;   recently enqueued value.
;;;
;;; The CDR of a discarded node is set to +DEAD-END+. This flag must
;;; be checked at each traversal.
