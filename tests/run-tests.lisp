;;; This is a bit of a hack designed to emulate a sandboxed test runner.
;;; For the sandbox to be properly set up to execute each test, it needs
;;; the names of the files that the test will access for reading.
;;; Without a sandbox, we want to fail in the same way that the sandboxed
;;; executor would, so that we can know when 'input-manifest.lisp-expr'
;;; needs to be edited.
;;; I'm not sure of the best way to allow deliberately nonexistent files
;;; here other than by hardcoding the names we expect.
;;; A more pedantic approach might check whether FILENAME definitely is
;;; a file on disk that was not declared. That's getting a bit insane,
;;; because then we'd have to keep track of directory changes, when this is
;;; only a bare minimum of effort to make sure that the manifest stays in
;;; sync with reality for people who run tests in the ordinary way.
;;;
;;; If *allowed-inputs* is :ANY, then we at worst print a note, and don't
;;; signal an error.  This was the simplest way I could imagine to get tests
;;; to pass when truenames don't match source file names, as long as declared
;;; input filtering has already happened.
;;; If you're using something like https://bazel.build/ then it provides
;;; the sandboxing, and the program under test shouldn't try to add another layer.
;;; e.g. if you have two worker nodes, one of them is in a file tree which for
;;; purposes of a test contains only the files named "run-tests.lisp" and
;;; "foo.pure.lisp", and the other has only "run-tests.lisp" and "bar.pure.lisp",
;;; - and perhaps they share storage - such that all of the files
;;; are actually links:
;;;   run-tests.lisp -> /blah/xyz12431/c984
;;;   foo.pure.lisp  -> /blah/zyz23431/c134
;;;   bar.pure.lisp  -> /blah/fr0bbotz/2344
;;; then everything that the code below tries to do to determine acceptability
;;; of filenames in pretty much broken.
