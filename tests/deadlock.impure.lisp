;;; I would optimistically guess that this test can no longer fail,
;;; even for :win32, since there is no lisp mutex around *all-threads*.
;;; (There is still the C one)
;;;
;;; With the sesion lock acquisition as part of thread startup,
;;; but with a patch that allows the thread creator to run while
;;; the child is waiting, all this test managed to do was create thousands
;;; of threads all blocked on the *SESSION-LOCK*, because MAKE-THREAD could
;;; return the created thread did anything at all.
;;; The way that happens is as follows:
;;;   thread 0: grab session lock, initiate GC
;;;             ... return from GC but not release session lock yet
;;;   thread 1: start sleeping
;;;   thread 2: try to grab session lock, enter a wait
;;;   thread 3: start sleeping
;;;   thread 4: try to grab session lock, enter a wait
;;;   thread 5: start sleeping
;;;   ...
;;; So the number of threads running simultaneously depends entirely on when
;;; the even numbered threads get CPU time to release the session lock.
;;;
;;; That said, I was curious why this test complete _so_ much slowly
;;; with faster thread start, and more quickly with slower thread start.
;;; Enabling the :deadlock-test-timing feature shows:
;;;
;;; Maxima attained: 2923 1 2923 2916 current=(2923 0 1 2922)
;;;                  ----   ----
;;;     tree node count ^      ^ nunber of threads in "run" state
;;;
;;; The answer is obvious: the time spent in each GC is proportional to
;;; the number of threads, and with faster thread start, we can actually
;;; achieve *nearly* 3000 threads running at the same time.
;;; With each thread allocating slightly over 4MiB of memory, that's
;;; about 12GiB of additional memory for the OS to manage which has
;;; a 2nd-order effect on our runtime as well.
;;; Contrast this with the "old way" where we were essentially
;;; firing off two threads at a time and letting them finish
;;; before getting to the next two.
